<h3>Apps that I used on the trips</h3>
I’m planning to move to the US with my spouse soon. Before he starts his job, we had a few months vacation due to the visa issue, so we visited Chiang Mai, Thailand with my mother in law, the cities in Portugal and London, just two of us, and Da Nang, Vietnam with my parents. For these trips, I used several new features and new apps that I wanted to share with fellow travelers.<br><br>

<strong>Google Maps</strong><br/>
Obviously, the best app for maps but Your places, Explore nearby, and Your timeline features were unexpectedly useful. <br/>
Before the trip, I looked for the places that I want to visit and added them to my Want to go list, shared with my spouse, and planned the route for the day. Your places enabled us to plan the trip of the day and visit the places we wanted. But I felt a little tired of opening the app over and over again, so I thought the notification, when I am near the saved places, would have been a useful tool during the trip.
Explore nearby was useful when we didn’t have any idea of where to go, and Your timeline was useful when I wrote the diary at night. It became much more useful when I wrote the diaries a few days later. The trip route definitely refreshed my memory :P
<h4>Triple</h4>

This is the app for Korean travelers. I heard about this on my favorite podcast and downloaded it before the trip. Triple introduces the cities and has a lot of information about the places to stay, visit, eat, and drink. I can save the places that I want to visit and get some tips from the editors and other users. This app shines on your first visit to the countries that you don’t know the language.
When my mother-in-law, my spouse, and I went to Chiang Mai, none of us had an idea about the language(we couldn’t even read the alphabet). Thanks to Triple, I had basic information about the places we want to visit (from how to go there to the history of the place). Also, Triple enables the users to write comments about the places so we could choose the trip schedules and restaurants based on the empirical comments.
The most useful function was creating the route. When I put the places that I want to visit, it automatically creates the best route for me. After I got the route, I could modify it as I want, which made it better.
My spouse and I didn’t use it to find restaurants in Portugal and London because we wanted to go to the restaurants where the local people go. (So we got some advice from the people we met.) If Triple can get more information about not-touristy restaurants, it would be awesome. (While writing this, I have the dilemma. If local restaurants become famous among tourists, they become touristy, so I’m not sure how this would work..)
As Triple has such a great database of trips, I think they would make a great app for travelers in Korea. Even though my country is small, there are so many beautiful places to visit and so many delicious foods! With a great database and the empirical reviews, the app could be a great help for first-time travelers.</p>
Lime
While walking around Lisbon, I spotted a lot of electric scooters: Lime, Hive, Tire, Voi, Bungo, and Wind. Eager to try this new kind of transportation, I persuaded my spouse for three days to try one of the scooters. We started our ride from Miradouro da Nossa Senhora do Monte and went to Jardim Botto Machado. The trip took 11 minutes and we rode 876 meters (0.54 miles). Lime said we saved 223 g of carbon each.
The handle was big for me so it was a bit hard to control the scooter at first but I became used to it soon. However, Lisbon downtown was not the best place to ride an electric scooter for me because the road is too rough. As the streets are covered with cobblestones, I could feel the stones with my whole body. And bicycle roads were not very common so it was a little dangerous. I wished I had have tried it at the beach because the road there was good for scooters. Once I have a chance to visit the country with scooter rental services again, I will definitely try it again on more comfortable roads.
Grab
I assume most people who traveled to Southeast Asia have used or heard of Grab. This is Southeast Asian version of Uber and Lyft but there was the episode that I wanted to include Grab to this list.
When I visited Vietnam with my parents and my spouse, a man approached us and said that he would drive us to the hotel with the amount of what Grab shows to avoid to pay commissions. He rushed us so we didn’t have much time to think it through. In the car, my mother and I were a little anxious. We, fortunately, got back to the hotel safely but I think I would never ride a car like that if I was alone or just with my spouse.
myrealtrip
This is a Korean service, which enables travelers to get cheaper tickets and USIM services. I bought the tickets for Warner Bros. Studio Tour London — The Making of Harry Potter and USIM for Thailand, Europe, and Vietnam.
Since I am a huge Harry Potter fan, visiting Harry Potter Studio was one of the biggest reason that I wanted to visit London. We tried to find the ticket a month prior to our visit but could not find the tickets. It was impossible to find the tickets we wanted. After we bought the refundable tickets, I found the tickets at myrealtrip.com! They were the cheapest tickets without the time limit. So we refunded the previous ones and got the new ones. Getting the actual tickets at the studio was easy and we spent 7 hours in the studio. We wandered around on our own pace and it was splendid.
Thanks to these wonderful services, I could enjoy fully in a few different countries and I still use some of them to look for the next trip.
