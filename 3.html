<h2>Women at work</h2>
<h3>Jeneva Patterson — Why Is Crying at Work Such a Big Deal?</h3>
I was surprised to see the article about the numbers of tears at the workplace. Crying is just one way of expressing my emotion, and I become calmer and more relaxed after crying. So, I feel the benefits of tears. I have cried several times for the last 3 years of my career and thought I should be ashamed of myself. But after reading this article, I acknowledge that I don’t have to be ashamed of crying but should talk about my feelings openly. I have never seen the people who express their emotion by being mad and mean to others are ashamed of themselves. However, crying at the workplace has been a shameful action to express feeling. I truly feel the necessity to change the atmosphere.

It’s a familiar narrative for women who cry at work: Escape to bathroom. Grab toilet paper. Wipe eyes. Blow nose. Take deep breath and sashay back into the conference rooms, banquet halls, auditoriums and hallways. Act as if we really did just have to use the facilities.

Most corporate cultures, built and directed by men who cry less frequently, do not accommodate these percentages.

On the other hand, instead of losing their executive presence, men generally benefit from crying at work. — Cathryn heard, “Pull it together Cathryn, crying at work is unseemly.” and Daniel was congratulated after tearfully announced to his team about his months off.

So if you cry at work, do one of the following:

Own your tears. If you’re not embarrassed about crying others won’t be embarrassed either. Take a breath. Say something like, “As you can see I have strong emotions about this topic because of how much I value our work.”
Laugh. There’s nothing that makes you and everyone else feel more comfortable than laughing together. If you manage to laugh through your tears you can say, “I guess you can see I care a lot about this.”
If you begin sobbing, excuse yourself, and leave the room. But when you come back or the next time you’re with that group bring it up again and talk about it transparently following numbers 1 and 2 above.
And if you are a leader and someone on your team cries, try these strategies:

Openly acknowledge that crying is a natural, autonomic process. This normalizes crying as a healthy behavior. You can say,“Obviously many of us feel strongly about this. It makes me feel like crying too!”
Share an example with your colleagues of when you cried at work. You’ll model that being vulnerable is ok which increases levels of trust and safety and gives implicit permission to someone else who might need to cry in the future. No need to wait for others to begin crying before you start.
